# Changelog

All notable changes to the HX Infrastructure API Gateway project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Comprehensive security hardening across the entire infrastructure
- Input validation and payload size limits in API gateway
- Enhanced security headers in HTTP responses
- Proper error handling for malformed YAML and JSON configurations
- Security validation for MASTER_KEY environment variables in deployment scripts

### Security

- **CRITICAL**: Removed hardcoded API keys from documentation examples
  - `README.md`: Replaced `sk-hx-dev-1234` with `$API_KEY` environment variable
  - `docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`: Replaced hardcoded key with `$YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder
  - `docs/PROJECT_BACKLOG_v2.md`: Systematically replaced all hardcoded tokens with `$API_KEY`
- **CRITICAL**: Eliminated hardcoded MASTER_KEY defaults in test scripts
  - Replaced `MASTER_KEY="${MASTER_KEY:-sk-hx-dev-1234}"` with secure validation logic
  - Added mandatory environment variable checks across 50+ shell scripts
  - Deployment scripts now require externally set MASTER_KEY with validation
- **MEDIUM**: Enhanced header filtering in main.py
  - Added comprehensive security header filtering to prevent header injection
  - Implemented payload size validation (max 1MB by default)
  - Added proper JSON validation with descriptive error messages
  - Enhanced security response headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **MEDIUM**: Improved error handling in routing middleware
  - Added robust YAML configuration validation with type checking
  - Enhanced JSON parsing with size limits and proper error responses
  - Implemented comprehensive exception handling for configuration loading

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Corrected service restart command in README.md
  - Fixed reference from non-existent `ollama` script to proper `api-gateway` service commands
- **MAJOR**: Removed duplicate content in PROJECT_BACKLOG.md
  - Eliminated 142-line duplicate section that was causing documentation confusion
  - Cleaned up malformed heading structure from previous partial removals

### Changed

- Test scripts now require MASTER_KEY to be explicitly set (no insecure defaults)
- API gateway enforces stricter input validation and security headers
- Documentation examples consistently use environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets
- Configuration loading includes comprehensive validation and error reporting

## Security Implementation Details

### API Key Management

- All documentation examples now reference environment variables
- Test scripts validate key presence and reject development/weak keys
- Deployment scripts enforce minimum key length and complexity requirements

### Input Validation

- Request body size limits prevent memory exhaustion attacks
- JSON parsing includes type validation and error handling
- YAML configuration loading validates structure and data types

### Header Security

- Comprehensive filtering of sensitive headers during proxy forwarding
- Security response headers prevent common web vulnerabilities
- Controlled client IP propagation with anti-spoofing measures

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation for malformed configuration files
- Descriptive error messages without information disclosure
- Proper exception handling throughout the request processing pipeline

**Note**: This changelog was created as part of a comprehensive security audit and remediation effort. All security fixes have been implemented and tested.
