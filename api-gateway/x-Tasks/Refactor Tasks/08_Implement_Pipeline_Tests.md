# Engineering Task Template

## Task Information
**Task ID:** ENG-008  
**Task Title:** Implement Automated Pipeline Tests
**Priority:** Medium  
**Assigned To:** Backend  
**Due Date:** 2025-09-02

---

## Execution Steps
1.  Create a new test directory: `/opt/HX-Infrastructure-/api-gateway/gateway/tests/`.
2.  Add `pytest` and `httpx` to the development dependencies in `requirements.txt` or a similar file.
3.  Create a new test suite (`test_pipeline.py`) within the new directory.
4.  Write unit tests for each critical middleware stage:
    - **SecurityMiddleware**: Test that requests with/without valid tokens return `200 OK` and `401 Unauthorized`, respectively.
    - **TransformMiddleware**: Test that a request to `/v1/embeddings` with a `prompt` field has it correctly transformed to an `input` field.
5.  Write a smoke test that uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to make live-like requests against the `build_app` factory to test the full pipeline integration.

## Validation Test
**Test Description:** Verify that the automated tests for the `GatewayPipeline` stages pass successfully.  
**Expected Result:** The `pytest` command exits with a `0` status code, and all tests are marked as `PASSED`.

### Test Steps
1.  Navigate to the gateway directory: `cd /opt/HX-Infrastructure-/api-gateway/gateway/`.
2.  Run the test suite: `pytest -q tests/` (Expected: All tests pass).
