## Execution Steps
1.  **Update Main README**: Edit `/opt/HX-Infrastructure-/api-gateway/README.md` to accurately reflect the new `GatewayPipeline` architecture. Remove any references to the old monolithic middleware.
2.  **Create Gateway README**: Create a `README.md` file in `/opt/HX-Infrastructure-/api-gateway/gateway/` that explains the pipeline stages (Security, Transform, etc.) and the role of the `middlewares` and `services` directories.
3.  **Document Configuration**: Note in the main `README.md` that `/opt/HX-Infrastructure-/api-gateway/config/api-gateway/` is the single source of truth for configuration.
4.  **Add Architecture Diagram**: Create a Mermaid diagram of the `GatewayPipeline` and embed it in the main `README.md`.
