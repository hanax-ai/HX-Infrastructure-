# API Gateway Backlog

## High Priority Items

### Version Alignment Task - Pydantic Ecosystem
**Status**: Deferred (OpenAPI crisis resolved, system stable)
**Priority**: Medium
**Assigned**: TBD

**Description**: 
Consider aligning Pydantic versions across the stack, but only after thorough testing in non-production environment.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ System working with current Pydantic 2.11.7
- ✅ OpenAPI generation functional
- ✅ All CRUD operations validated
- ⚠️ Version alignment with newer FastAPI versions deferred

**Specific Changes to Consider** (TESTING REQUIRED):
```
fastapi~=0.111  # From current 0.115.14
uvicorn[standard]~=0.30  # From current 0.29.0  
httpx~=0.27  # From current 0.28.1
# pydantic - LEAVE ALONE (2.11.7 working perfectly)
```

**Risk Assessment**: 
- **Low Risk**: Current versions are stable and functional
- **Medium Risk**: Version downgrades might introduce compatibility issues
- **High Risk**: Touching Pydantic after OpenAPI crisis resolution

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Full test suite execution
- [ ] OpenAPI generation validation
- [ ] Integration testing with real Qdrant
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

**Decision**: 
Defer until next maintenance window. Current system is production-ready with existing versions.
